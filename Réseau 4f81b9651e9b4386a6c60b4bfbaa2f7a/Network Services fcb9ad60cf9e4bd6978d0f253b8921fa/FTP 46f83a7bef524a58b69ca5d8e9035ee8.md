# FTP

## What is it ?

File Transfer Protocol → Client-server model

→ allow remote transfer of files over a network 

**How does it work ?** 

A FTP session operates using two channels :

- command (contrôle) channel
- data channel (Données)

**two modes** : ( may support each or both ) 

- Active FTP connection

→ client opens a port and listens ; The server is required to **actively** connect to it 

- Passive FTP connection

→ the server opens a port and listens **passively** and the client connects to it

## Exploiting

→ we learned that it may be a user named Mike in the public document in the anonymous profile

→ trying to bruteforce the password with Hydra

→ syntax here : 

**"hydra -t 4 -l user -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV ip ftp"**

Let's break it down:

SECTION             FUNCTION

hydra                   Runs the hydra tool

-t 4                    Number of parallel connections per target

-l [user]               Points to the user who's account you're trying to compromise

-P [path to dictionary] Points to the file containing the list of possible passwords

-vV                     Sets verbose mode to very verbose, shows the login+pass combination for each attempt

[machine IP]            The IP address of the target machine

ftp / protocol          Sets the protocol
