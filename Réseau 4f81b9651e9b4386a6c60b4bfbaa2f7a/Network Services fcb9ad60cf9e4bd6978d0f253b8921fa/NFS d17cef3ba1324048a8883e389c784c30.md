# NFS

## **What is NFS ?**

Network File System 

→ allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network 

→ almost as if they were local files

**How does it work ? :**

- client → request to mount a directory  from remote host on a local directory ( as if it were a physical device ) → the mount service will connect to the mount daemon with RPC
- Server → checks is the user has permission the desired directory
- → will return a file handle wich **uniquely** identifies each file and directory on the server

If someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. This call takes parameters such as:

- The file handle
- The name of the file to be accessed
- The user's, user ID
- The user's group ID

## Enumerating

new tool → nfs-common 

→ going to use showmount and mount.dfs 

( more infos on [https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/nfs-common](https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/nfs-common) )

the one that's interesting → 2049 

/usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP] → list the NFS shares

→

Okay now we're gonna mount the share to our local machine

→ we make a directory mount in the tmp directory to share to 

 

Your client’s system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can createthis folder anywhere on your system. Once you've created this mount point, you can use the "mount" command to connect the NFS share to the mount point on your machine like so:

**sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock**

Let's break this down

now we have done this, there's a new folder in mount, in this case it seems like a user's folder, we have a .ssh so we look into it

→ youhou a id_rsa again → we chmod 600 it after moving it into our .ssh

we're now able to ssh

## Exploiting

we have low-privilege → we're trying to escalate privileges 

**root_squash :** 

root squashing is enabled by default → prevents anyone connecting to the NFS share from having root access to the NFS volume 

→ by default we're "nfsnobody", with the lowest privileges.

if there's no root squashing → we're able to create SUID bit files → allowing a remote user root access to the connected system 

**But what is SUID ?** 

It means that the file can be run with the permissions of the file owner/group (here the super-user)

→ to get a shell 

**How could we do this ?** 

We're able to upload files to the NFS share, and control the permissions of these files. We can set the permissions of whatever we upload, in this case a bash shell executable. We can then log in through SSH, as we did in the previous task- and execute this executable to gain a root shell!

we downloaded this basic bash ( [https://github.com/polo-sec/writing/tree/master/Security Challenge Walkthroughs/Networks 2](https://github.com/polo-sec/writing/tree/master/Security%20Challenge%20Walkthroughs/Networks%202) ) 

**Pathway :** 

NFS Access ->

Gain Low Privilege Shell ->

Upload Bash Executable to the NFS share -> **"sudo chown root bash"** 

Set SUID Permissions Through NFS Due To Misconfigured Root Squash -> **"sudo chmod +[permission] bash"  ( permission for SUID is "s" ) ( make sure it has executable right )** 

Login through SSH ->

Execute SUID Bit Bash Executable -> **"./bash -p"**  ( the -p is to persists the permissions )

ROOT ACCESS

(tip : "cp ~/Downloads/bash ." to cp from a directory to the current one we're in )
