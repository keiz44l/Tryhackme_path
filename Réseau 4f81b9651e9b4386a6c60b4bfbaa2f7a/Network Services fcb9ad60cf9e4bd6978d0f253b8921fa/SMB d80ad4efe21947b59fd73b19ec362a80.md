# SMB

## **What is SMB ?**

Server Message Block Protocol → client-server communication protocol 

→ sharing files/printers/serial ports.... on a network 

→ response-request protocol → transmits messages between the client and server to etablish a connection 

![Untitled](SMB%20d80ad4efe21947b59fd73b19ec362a80/Untitled.png)

after connection → clients can send commands ( SMBs ) → to have access shares etc

for SMB → over the network 

Windows ( since 95 ) have SMB 

Unix → with Samba

## Enumerating SMB

At first :

[Port scanning with nmap](../Port%20scanning%20with%20nmap%206a379ffb3b964d1c95e0fcb21e9ac632.md)

After : 

Using ***Enum4linux*** 

→ "enum4linux [options] ip"

**TAG**            **FUNCTION**

- U           get userlist
- M          get machine list
- N          get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)
- S           get sharelist
- P           get password policy information
- G           get group and member list
- A           all of the above (full basic enumeration)

Ports SMB → 139/445

## Exploiting SMB

Vulnerabilities like [https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-7494/](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-7494/) allow remote code exploitation 

Most likely → misconfigurations in the system 

### Exploiting anonymous SMB share-access :

After enumeration we have :

- SMB share location
- name of an interesting SMB share ( in THM's case → "profiles" )

We're gonna use ***SMB share***

→ access the SMB share using : "smbclient //[IP]/[Share] -U -p

-U : user

-p : port

→ use "more" to read a non-private document 

Warning : to gain access to ssh's account with rsa keys → put them in .ssh and chmod 600 them
